Every prompt the pipeline sends to a model, in one place.

These were previously inline literals spread across five modules, and two had
drifted into being byte-identical copies: the system prompt Agent 4 uses to
suggest a citation, and the one evaluate_rag.py sends when generating the
responses it scores. That meant the Ragas evaluation measured a duplicate
rather than the prompt Agent 4 actually runs — tuning one would have left the
evaluation quietly reporting faithfulness for the other.

Templates use str.format placeholders. Note that CITE_SENTENCE_SYSTEM contains
literal LaTeX braces (``\\cite{key}``) and is therefore a plain constant, not a
template — do not call .format() on it.
